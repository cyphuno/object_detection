The repository provides all the files needed to train a "Pinochle Deck" playing card detector that can accurately detect nines, tens, jacks, queens, kings, and aces. The tutorial describes how to replace these files with your own files to train a detection classifier for whatever your heart desires. It also has Python scripts to test your classifier out on an image, video, or webcam feed.

## Introduction
The purpose of this tutorial is to explain how to train your own convolutional neural network object detection classifier for multiple objects, starting from scratch. At the end of this tutorial, you will have a program that can identify and draw boxes around specific objects in pictures, videos, or in a webcam feed.

There are several good tutorials available for how to use TensorFlow's Object Detection API to train a classifier for a single object. However, these usually using Linux system to develop. Not firendly for the windows users, If you have better graphics card. It's easy to  use tensorflow object detection API to own's classification.

TensorFlow-GPU allows your PC to use the video card to provide extra processing power while training, so it will be used for this tutorial. In my experience, using TensorFlow-GPU instead of regular TensorFlow reduces training time by a factor of about 8 (3 hours to train instead of 24 hours). Regular TensorFlow can also be used for this tutorial, but it will take longer. If you use regular TensorFlow, you do not need to install CUDA and cuDNN in Step 1. I used TensorFlow-GPU v1.5 while writing this tutorial, but it will likely work for future versions of TensorFlow.


## Steps
### 1. Install TensorFlow-GPU 1.5 

The video is made for TensorFlow-GPU v1.4, but the ：pip install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu； command will automatically download version 1.5. Download and install CUDA v9.0 and cuDNN v7.0 (rather than CUDA v8.0 and cuDNN v6.0 as instructed in the video), because they are supported by TensorFlow-GPU v1.5. As future versions of TensorFlow are released, you will likely need to continue updating the CUDA and cuDNN versions to the latest supported version.

Be sure to install Anaconda with Python 3.6 as instructed in the video, python 3.7 isn't support tensorflow is this time.
Visit [TensorFlow's website](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows) for further installation details, including how to install it on other operating systems (like Linux). The [object detection repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) itself also has [installation instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md).
